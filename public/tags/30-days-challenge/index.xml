      <description>I am not a calm person, or someone who finds equilibrium very easily. I tend to go to extremes in everything I do, either giving too much or too little. For me, consistency in what I do is the most difficult thing to achieve.
I have always been jealous of my mother, who is a calm and self-controlled person. Nothing is important enough to disturb her inner peace, or lose sleep over it.</description>
