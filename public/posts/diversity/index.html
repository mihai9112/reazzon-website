                        <p>Diversity and inclusion are now amongst the values of all modern businesses, but what does it actually mean to have a diverse work force and make sure everybody feels like they belong? How is the journey like for “the minorities” and can businesses do more to support them?</p>

<p>My journey in the corporate world has been scattered with a lot of frustration along the way. I was born and raised in Eastern Europe, where success is defined by a black and white approach: you&rsquo;re either right, and you&rsquo;re successful, or you&rsquo;re wrong, and you&rsquo;re failing at whatever you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>In the first years of my career I constantly felt like I was losing the corporate battle. I had moved to UK to have a fulfilling career, but I was far away from one. I was seeing myself as a failure because I was wrong more often than I was right. Every time I was asked to share my opinion in a work context, I was giving different answers than the rest of my team. It was hard to feel like I was making an impact since I wasn&rsquo;t reaching agreement with the decision makers. But isn’t it what diversity is about? Companies work hard to foster a diverse cultural environment because they ultimately want to encourage diversity of thought. This is what makes their solutions and level of service better. However, having a different opinion is an uncomfortable position to be in, and sometimes is accompanied by a feeling of not being able to fit in.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to understand that I wasn&rsquo;t failing. What I was feeling was just the consequence of representing a minority group. Thinking back at the first years of my career, I wish I had a support network of people with similar backgrounds, similar aspirations, that went through the same challenges I was going through. I ultimately built that support network myself, but it hasn&rsquo;t been easy and I am sure I missed some opportunities on the way. My educational and cultural background didn&rsquo;t prepare me for this, so I found it difficult to approach people face to face, particularly when those people were my work colleagues. I wanted to know how my Eastern European female peers were so influential and successful, but I wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to talk about it face to face. Instead, I read a lot of online forums on career advice, and most of them were not relevant to my problem. Building a support network is a slow process, but critical during the first years in your career when you try to understand what you enjoy and what you want to do in the future.</p>

<p>Reazzon is my way to give back to other &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; who are struggling with all different kinds of problems, and are resilient and determined to find a solution. It&rsquo;s also my way to signal that companies could do more to support the minority groups they have in their workforce. And finally, it&rsquo;s an attempt to give a voice and tools to those people who are not brave enough to open doors, but are desperaty to find an answer to their questions.</p>

<p>For all the minorities out there!</p>
