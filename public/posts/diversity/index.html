                   <p>Diversity and inclusion are now amongst the values of all modern businesses, but what does it actually mean to have a diverse work force and make sure everybody feels like they belong? How is the journey like for &ldquo;the minorities&rdquo; and can businesses do more to support them?</p>

<p>My journey in the corporate world has been scattered with a lot of frustration along the way. I was born and raised in Eastern Europe, where
success is defined by how many questions you can answer correctly. Your life is a constant pub quiz, and you&rsquo;re either winning or failing</p>

<p>In the first years of my career I was constantly feeling like I was Failing at the corporate battle. Failing because I was wrong more often than I was right. I was giving different answers on how to do things than the rest of my team, having a different perspective on how to solve the problems, or communicate to clients. I was constantly feeling like I wasn&rsquo;t making an impact, because I wasn&rsquo;t reaching an agreement with the rest of the team.</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t it what diversity is about? Companies are working hard to foster a diverse cultural environment because they ultimately want to encourage diversity of thought. This is what makes their solutions and level of service  better. What about inclusion? Once I understood that what I was feeling wasn&rsquo;t failure, but just the consequence of being part of a minority, I wanted to do more to feel included. And I started to look up to all my female peers in the same industry with me, and with similar backgrounds, that had experienced success and were willing to share their experiences with me. So I read the forums, and sent emails to my colleagues, looked for mentors and talked to my friends, whom, I was surprised to discovered, were sharing the same struggles as me. I started talking about it and I immediately felt included, in a much larger community of people who were feeling the same. I stop being a failure when I realizes my problem was shared by some many of my peers with similar background. This feeling by itself empowered me to find solutions. By talking with my peers I learned how to challenge my perceptions of the corporate world and what success is, and create a much healthier value system. I learned how to navigate cultural differences through communication, and how to filter the information I am given to ask the right follow up questions. they ve offered specific recommendations on how to deal with tense situations or conflict at work. And the result was growth. In my career, in my ambitions and perception of my  skills. I built a network of peers, but I had to go out there and look for them in all these various places, spending a lot of time reading information that was maybe irrelevant for the challenge I was facing. This is how Reazzon was born, from my need to find a community to discuss and solve problems together. Not only career struggles, but all kind of problems that we all share and should work together to solve, to improve our life.</p>
