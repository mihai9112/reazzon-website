Diversity and inclusion are now amongst the values of all modern businesses, but what does it actually mean to have a diverse work force and make sure everybody feels like they belong? How is the journey like for “the minorities” and can businesses do more to support them?

My journey in the corporate world has been scattered with a lot of frustration along the way. I was born and raised in Eastern Europe, where success is defined by a black and white approach: you're either right, and you're successful, or you're wrong, and you're failing at whatever you are trying to achieve.

In the first years of my career I constantly felt like I was losing the corporate battle. I had moved to UK to have a fulfilling career, but I was far away from one. I was seeing myself as a failure because I was wrong more often than I was right. Every time I was asked to share my opinion in a work context, I was giving different answers than the rest of my team. It was hard to feel like I was making an impact since I wasn't reaching agreement with the decision makers. But isn’t it what diversity is about? Companies work hard to foster a diverse cultural environment because they ultimately want to encourage diversity of thought. This is what makes their solutions and level of service better. However, having a different opinion is an uncomfortable position to be in, and sometimes is accompanied by a feeling of not being able to fit in.  

It took me a long time to understand that I wasn't failing. What I was feeling was just the consequence of representing a minority group. Thinking back at the first years of my career, I wish I had a support network of people with similar backgrounds, similar aspirations, that went through the same challenges I was going through. I ultimately built that support network myself, but it hasn't been easy and I am sure I missed some opportunities on the way. My educational and cultural background didn't prepare me for this, so I found it difficult to approach people face to face, particularly when those people were my work colleagues. I wanted to know how my Eastern European female peers were so influential and successful, but I wasn't brave enough to talk about it face to face. Instead, I read a lot of online forums on career advice, and most of them were not relevant to my problem. Building a support network is a slow process, but critical during the first years in your career when you try to understand what you enjoy and what you want to do in the future.

Reazzon is my way to give back to other "minorities" who are struggling with all different kinds of problems, and are resilient and determined to find a solution. It's also my way to signal that companies could do more to support the minority groups they have in their workforce. And finally, it's an attempt to give a voice and tools to those people who are not brave enough to open doors, but are desperaty to find an answer to their questions.


For all the minorities out there!
