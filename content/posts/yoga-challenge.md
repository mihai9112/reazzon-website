I am not a calm person, or someone who finds equilibrium very easily. I tend to go to extremes in everything I do, either giving too much or too little. For me, consistency in what I do is the most difficult thing to achieve.

I have always been jealous of my mother, who is a calm and self-controlled person. Nothing is important enough to disturb her inner peace, or lose sleep over it. Throughout her career and personal life, my mum has been very successful at everything she wanted to do, and I always suspected it was due to her ability to maintain a clear mind through difficult situations. I now want to test this assumption on my own situation, setting the challenge of achieving my inner balance and monitor whether it truly has an impact on how successful I am.

I started practicing yoga 7 years ago, when I moved to London, mostly out of curiosity. I struggled to create a habit, because yoga takes time and practice to become good at it, and one of my biggest weaknesses is my lack of patience. Two weeks ago I had my first yoga class after one year of binge practicing.  It started with downward dog, warrior one and two, and ended with a scratch on my wrist that might leave a permanent mark. Leaving aside the embarrassment of having to explain that I injured myself at yoga for the next 2 weeks, I thoroughly enjoyed the class, the calmness of the teacher and my own surprise at being able to stay in some of the positions for much longer than I expected. I felt peaceful and focused after the class, but it quickly disappeared through the week, as I became swamped with work and personal things.

On the morning of my second class I had a meltdown, and I surprisingly found myself applying Yoga techniques to calm down (taking deep breaths and focusing on my breathing pace). I continued to feel unease throught the day, but I calmed myself in that moment and managed to move on. 
The second class was shorter than scheduled as I had to leave earlier to join a call at work. It was a pity, because I loved that teacher and the structure of the class, which was more dynamic than the fist one, with more poses, hence more challenges. I also felt a personal improvement in my physical balance, strength and flexibility during the second class.

I am now two weeks in the challenge, and this is my current routine:

* Weekly Yoga classes (taught classes at my gym or yoga studio) – I now go to the same gym where I go to exercise, but I have tried yoga studios in the past and enjoyed them more. I am considering subscribing to one if I manage to stick to the schedule for more than just one month. I am keen to continue attending taught classes because I like the comfort of having someone there who knows what is doing and will correct your pose when needed.

* Daily 15 minutes yoga morning routine – I thought this will be difficult to stick to, as I am not a morning person and I don’t enjoy exercising in the morning. I keep it to 10-15 minutes only, so I can enjoy it and not dread waking up earlier for it. This is the area of risk for me, as I know I will only need one stressful night to stop and fall out of this routine.

* Running, spinning or gym classes (other than yoga) twice a week – I have been doing these regularly for the last 10 months, and I can tell the difference when I don’t stick to it. It helps with my physical health (digestion, skin and muscles) but also my mental one as I know my stress level hoes up when I don’t do any sport.

My Conclusions after 2 weeks…

* I was secretly hoping that one yoga class per week will take all my problems away. And it doesn’t. It’s not a “pill”, and for the effect to be lasting it requires regular practice.
* I was surprised to see how I default to yoga techniques during moments of intense stress or tension. I will continue to use it as a crisis management tool and document the results.
* It’s less about yoga and it’s more about sport.  Being physically active has a positive effect on my mental health and my capacity to manage stress. Yoga is not the only answer, but one of the answers, as  it’s just another type of sport. I happen to like it more than spinning, body pumping or anything else that requires you to sweat until you die, because it’s less about competing with others and it’s more about competing with yourself. But this is ultimately a matter of preference.
