In the last couple of weeks I have constantly had that feeling of frustrastion coming from doing what I need vs doing what I want. I enjoy the fulfilment of completing the most important task for that day, or reaching the end of a project, or simply just cutting a task off my To Do list. But I equally enjoy (maybe even more) the happiness of doing something for myself, for my soul. Living an experience that I'll never forget, creating memories I will later talk about with my friends and family, laughing until my face hurts or just spending time with the people I love. And as much as I enjoy success, I haven't yet experienced the success that would equal any of the above. 

I am overworking myself from a desire to be better, not miss any opportunity and leave something behind. I take full responsibility for it, and I know I am in control to drop projects and start saying "no". However, I also like to stretch my limits because I see myself as a work in progress and I am never happy with what I have achieved, always wanting more. But sometimes it's difficult to know where the line is and as much as I want more, I also want it quick. A lot of my frustration and unhappiness comes from setting too ambitious deadlines and not being able to meet them. As a consequence of those deadlines I am also overcharging my schedule leaving no time for those experience I so much love. 

I am on a journey to rediscover my balance. I want to learn how to prioritize my project and practice saying "no" to those I am not interested in. I want to plan my day to fit a diverse range of activities in it, and find a balance between work, sport, and leisure time. And finally, I will try different relaxation techniques each of them for 2 weeks, and track my progress to determine what works and what doesn't.  

Keep watching this blog to complete this journey with me.
